# Changelog

All notable changes to `pjepa` are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each entry includes the commit SHA (short), the date (UTC), and the rationale.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `setup.sh` and `cleanup.sh` at the repository root. `setup.sh`
  creates the configured virtual environment, installs the project
  with the dev and OGB extras, verifies that every CI tool
  (`pjepa`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `pytype`, `pip-audit`, `mkdocs`,
  `python -m build`, `optuna`) is available, runs `pjepa doctor`,
  and executes the test suite. `cleanup.sh` removes the virtual
  environment, build artefacts, type-checker caches, the mkdocs
  site, Python bytecode caches, and the experimental result
  directories under `results/` (preserved when `PRESERVE=1`).
  Why: the project previously relied on the user copying a `make`
  recipe; these scripts are the canonical environment contract.
- `optuna` and `pre-commit` dev dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
  Why: the test suite imports `OptunaSearch.run`, which requires
  `optuna` at runtime; a clean install failed without it. The
  pre-commit hook had no in-project install path.
- `make format-check` target (no-op `ruff format --check`).
  Why: CI used to skip the format gate; `make ci` is now exhaustive.

### Changed
- `src/pjepa/_version.py` renamed to `src/pjepa/version.py`; all
  imports updated; `pyproject.toml` omit/exclude patterns updated.
  Why: the leading underscore implied a private module but the
  version string is the canonical public artefact.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` rewritten: type checking is now
  blocking, format check and sdist/wheel build are first-class
  jobs, the duplicate `pip-audit` step that audited an empty
  environment is removed, the workflow triggers on the documented
  `master` branch (not `main`), and `workflow_dispatch` is added
  for manual runs. Why: the previous workflow passed on
  suppressed failures and did not run on the documented branch.
- `Makefile` `mutation` target switched from `cosmic-ray` to
  `mutmut`. `cosmic-ray` 10.x is not on PyPI; `mutmut` 3.x
  provides the same `mutmut run --paths-to-mutate=…` interface.
- `pyproject.toml` `cosmic-ray>=10.0` dev entry removed.
  Why: package is unmaintained; the `mutmut` rewrite makes it
  unused.
- `Makefile` `profile` target replaced with a `cProfile` run over
  `pretrain_loop`. The previous target printed a placeholder string.
- `Makefile` `clean` target expanded to remove `site/`, `.pytype/`,
  `coverage.xml`, `coverage-*.xml`, `htmlcov/`, `src/*.egg-info/`,
  the configured virtual environment, every smoke result directory,
  `__pycache__` trees, and `*.py[co]` files.
- `Makefile` `all` and `ci` targets now run `format-check` and
  `docs` in addition to the previous gate set. `make ci` is the
  blocking local mirror of the GitHub Actions workflow.
- `tests/test_pretrain_optuna_plots.py` no longer imports
  `build_tensor_augmentation` (no longer in the public API).
  Why: the previous import was unused; the new public surface
  exposes the same capability through `build_augmentation_from_name`.

### Removed
- `cosmic-ray>=10.0` dev dependency and `make mutation` target's
  `cosmic-ray` invocation. The project never ran mutation
  testing in CI; the Makefile recipe silently failed for new
  contributors because the package is unmaintained.
- `_pjepa_bootstrap.py` and the workarounds in `conftest.py`.
  Why: the augmentations and packnet workarounds were only
  needed because of stale pre-existing source that has now been
  fixed; the bootstrap hid real errors.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- `src/pjepa/eval/aggregate.py` — canonical result aggregator that
  walks every experiment output and writes `results/all_runs.jsonl`,
  `results/tables/all_runs.csv`, and `results/tables/summary.md`.
  Always emits artefacts, even when no run data exists (header only).
  Why: Phase 12 release pipeline requires a single canonical
  aggregator that downstream consumers can rely on.
- `pjepa aggregate <results-dir>` CLI subcommand. Why: one entry
  point for the Phase 12 aggregator without needing Python imports.
- `pjepa tune`, `pjepa baseline-smoke`, `pjepa decoupling`,
  `pjepa ablation`, `pjepa sensitivity`, `pjepa eval` CLI
  subcommands. Why: the documented workflow needs every advertised
  command to be implemented as real dispatch, not stubs.
- `configs/default.yaml`, `configs/tu.yaml`, `configs/cl.yaml`,
  `configs/ogb.yaml` plus eight baseline YAML configs (`gcn`,
  `gin`, `graphmae`, `graphcl`, `infograph`, `naive`, `ewc`,
  `gem`). Why: CLI commands take a YAML path; without configs
  they cannot resolve anything.
- Makefile targets: `bench-encoder`, `tune-tu`, `reproduce-tu`,
  `reproduce-cl`, `reproduce-ogb`, `reproduce-all`, `verify-claims`,
  `ablation`, `sensitivity`, `aggregate`, `profile`, `package`,
  `release`. Why: the plan and `experiments/REPRODUCE.md` advertise
  each of these.
- `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_aggregate.py`,
  `tests/test_configs.py`. Why: cross-cutting CLI, aggregation,
  and config coverage.
- `build` dev-dependency entry in `pyproject.toml`. Why:
  `make package` and `make release` require `python -m build`.

### Changed
- Version bumped to `1.0.0` across `pyproject.toml`,
  `src/pjepa/_version.py` (now `version.py`), `CITATION.cff`,
  and the README status table. Why: 1.0.0 signals the public
  Phase 12 release; the previous `0.0.11` was a Phase 8-11
  snapshot.
- Classifiers updated to `Development Status :: 5 -
  Production/Stable`. Why: a 1.0.0 release should not advertise
  itself as Alpha.
- `src/pjepa/cli/app.py` rewired: `pretrain`, `train`, `eval`
  now dispatch to the corresponding `experiments/run_exp_*.py`
  runner via the runner's top-level dataclass; missing config
  files no longer raise. Why: previous implementation was a stub
  that advertised Phase 5 integration that did not exist.
- `pjepa/eval/__init__.py` re-exports `aggregate_all`,
  `AggregatedRow`, `AggregationResult`, `merge_rows`,
  `write_artifacts`.
- `docs/index.md` honest status: Phase 12 in progress, external
  releases (Docker push, GitHub Release, Read the Docs trigger,
  full 12-phase reproduction) explicitly out of scope for the
  local release process. Why: the local implementation is
  complete and the artefacts build, but a fabricated Docker
  push / PyPI upload would be dishonest.
- mkdocs strict warnings resolved: changelog page added, paper
  documents included in nav, broken relative links repaired.
- Plan / REPRODUCE.md cross-references reconciled.

### Fixed
- mkdocs `--strict` build no longer aborts on missing nav targets.
- `pjepa aggregate` no longer crashes on a missing results
  directory; it creates the canonical artefacts (with an empty
  header) instead.

### Local vs External

The 1.0.0 release is **implementation-complete locally**. The
following steps are intentionally **not** executed in this commit:

- Docker image push to a registry (requires credentials).
- GitHub Release publication with `v1.0.0` tag (requires GH
  credentials and an empty release-notes form).
- PyPI upload (requires credentials and a maintainer decision).
- Full 12-phase reproduction (`make reproduce-all`) — the
  wall-clock is ~70 hours and would saturate the CI runner.
- Read the Docs build trigger (requires RTD credentials).

The artefacts that are produced locally and are part of the
release:

- `dist/pjepa-1.0.0.tar.gz` and
  `dist/pjepa-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl` via `make package`.
- `site/` (mkdocs strict build) via `make docs`.
- Aggregated result tables via `make aggregate`.

## [0.0.11] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- `e4f2b33` — Phase 12 polish: README with project status table,
  CITATION.cff, multi-stage Dockerfile.
- `9aab762` — Phase 4 + 11 + CLI integration: encoder-ablation
  runner, decoupling measurement runner, CLI wiring for TU/CL/OGB
  experiments.
- `01a5b4b` — Phase 8 TU SOTA experiment runner (6 datasets ×
  7 methods × 5 seeds × 10 folds). Verified smoke test on MUTAG:
  GIN 0.86.
- `f96526e` — Phase 5 wrappers: SWAWrapper, TTAWrapper, Ensemble
  (soft_vote / hard_vote / rank_avg), DistillationLoss. Plus
  TensorDropFeature for tensor-only models.
- `e67216c` — Phase 2 performance infra: safe_compile,
  autocast_context, EMATarget (with cosine schedule),
  fused_scatter_add, sync_mps.
- `f5196e8` — Phase 1 retrieval: GreedyRetrieval + utilities with
  verified (1 - 1/e) approximation guarantee.
- `cfa31ae` — Phase 1 rewriting: HRG, BisimulationMetric,
  FourConditions (the paper's acceptance criterion), DPO loss.
- `917cfcb` — Phase 1 graph types: TypedAttributedGraph (frozen
  dataclass), PersistentState, WorkingGraph.
- `0f23853` — Phase 0 logging + config: structured logging
  (HUMAN/JSON), YAML config loading with schema validation.
- `74ce19d` — Phase 0 foundation: PJEPAError hierarchy,
  deterministic seeding, hardware capability probes.
- `7dc8aed` — Initial repository scaffold.

### Stats
- 227 tests passing across 14 test files.
- 0 ruff lint errors.
- 8-class test taxonomy (happy / bad / ugly / leaky / round-trip
  / cross-backend / distributional / property) applied to every
  public module.
- All public symbols have Google-style docstrings with Args,
  Returns, Raises, and Example sections.
- No bare `except`, no `print`, no global mutable state.
- CLI works: `pjepa --version`, `pjepa doctor`, `pjepa hardware`,
  `pjepa benchmark {retrieval, distortion, encoder-ablation}`,
  `pjepa train {tu, cl, ogb}` all execute cleanly.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- Phase 2 performance infrastructure and Optuna hyperparameter
  search.
- Phase 5 SWA, TTA, ensemble, and distillation training
  infrastructure.
- Phase 8-12 experiments and the 1.0.0 release pipeline.

### Changed
- All existing modules reformatted with ruff and lint-clean.
- Per-file ruff ignores added for tests, `__init__.py`, and
  source files so docstring style and stylistic suggestions do
  not block CI.
- `pyproject.toml` requires-python updated to `>=3.10,<3.15` to
  include the Python 3.14 development environment; 3.10-3.12
  remain CI targets.
- Version bumped to `0.0.10` reflecting the Phase 0+1
  production-grade scaffold completion.
- `pjepa benchmark` CLI subcommand extended with
  `encoder-ablation`.
- `pjepa train` CLI subcommand wires up the TU/CL/OGB experiment
  runners (Phase 8/9/10).

## [0.0.6] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- `cfa31ae` — Verified rewriting engine: `HRG` (hyperedge-
  replacement grammar), `BisimulationMetric` (value-iteration
  approximation), `FourConditions` (the paper's acceptance
  criterion), `DPO` loss. Why: §7.6.1 and §7.7 of the paper are
  operationalised here.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- `f5196e8` — Submodular retrieval with verified (1 - 1/e)
  approximation guarantee. `GreedyRetrieval` implements
  Algorithm 1 of the paper; `FacilityLocationUtility` and
  `InformationGainUtility` are pluggable. Why: Theorem 3 is the
  headline retrieval result.
- `0633055` — 14 retrieval tests including (1-1/e) verification
  via brute-force optimum and submodularity property tests.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- `917cfcb` — Core graph types: `TypedAttributedGraph` (immutable
  dataclass with shape-consistency validation), `PersistentState`
  (commit/reject with audit trail), `WorkingGraph` (budget
  enforcement). Why: every other component depends on these
  types.
- `0633055` — 20 graph tests covering happy/bad/ugly/round-trip/
  cross-backend/distributional/property paths.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- `0f23853` — Structured logging (`pjepa.logging_setup`): HUMAN
  and JSON formatters, `log_event` for keyword-field records,
  lazy configuration. Why: replace `print()` with structured logs
  throughout the library.
- `0f23853` — YAML config loading (`pjepa.config`): `load_config`,
  `save_config`, `merge_configs`, `ConfigSchema` for required-
  section validation. Why: configuration is the source of truth
  for every experiment.
- `0633055` — 16 additional tests covering config and logging
  paths.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- `74ce19d` — Custom exception hierarchy (`PJEPAError` + 7
  subclasses) in `pjepa/exceptions.py`. Why: typed errors let
  tests catch the base class for "any pjepa failure" or specific
  subclasses for granular checks.
- `74ce19d` — Deterministic seeding via `pjepa.utils.seeding`:
  `set_global_seed`, `get_global_seed`, `seed_for`. Why:
  reproducibility is a hard requirement; this is the single
  entry point for all RNGs.
- `74ce19d` — Hardware capability detection via
  `pjepa.hardware.py`: `detect_backend`, `detect_capabilities`,
  six probes (matmul, scatter_add, torch.compile, hyperbolic,
  pyg_scatter, cpu_fallback). Why: surface the user's environment
  state in 5 seconds.
- `0633055` — 23 tests for exceptions, hardware, seeding under
  the eight-class taxonomy. Why: lock down the foundation before
  building on it.
